## üìò Project Title  
**Academic Performance Analysis and Monitoring using AWS for Policy 9023p**

## üìÑ Project Overview  

This portfolio showcases a cloud-based data analytics solution developed using AWS to support the analysis and monitoring of academic performance under University Canada West‚Äôs Academic Standing Policy (9023p). The project was completed as part of the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations course and focuses on descriptive analysis and infrastructure monitoring. The policy defines how student performance is assessed based on GPA and CGPA to determine academic standing statuses such as Good Standing, Alert, Probation, Suspension, or Required to Withdraw. The solution utilizes Amazon S3 for data storage, AWS Glue and DataBrew for data wrangling, Amazon Athena for querying, and CloudWatch and CloudTrail for monitoring. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in securely storing, transforming, analyzing, and monitoring academic datasets in a cloud environment while aligning with real-world institutional requirements.

## üéØ Objective  

The main objective of this project was to build a data-driven, cloud-native solution that could effectively analyze and monitor student performance in accordance with UCW‚Äôs Academic Standing Policy (9023p). This involved using AWS services to manage the full data lifecycle ‚Äî from ingestion and wrangling to querying, analysis, and monitoring. The goal was to create meaningful insights that could support academic decisions such as issuing alerts, probation notices, or suspensions, while also ensuring the system followed best practices in security, automation, and monitoring.

## üßæ Dataset  

The dataset used in this project consisted of student academic records, which included student ID, name, enrollment year, academic program, GPA, CGPA, and the actions taken based on their performance. These datasets were stored in structured CSV and Parquet formats across three Amazon S3 buckets: `registrar-raw-nav`, `registrar-trf-nav`, and `registrar-cur-nav`. Each bucket was organized using logical prefixes such as year, quarter, and server, allowing efficient querying and partitioning. AWS Glue Crawlers were used to catalog the datasets into the Glue Data Catalog, enabling seamless SQL querying via Amazon Athena. This setup formed the foundation for reliable and reusable data pipelines and ensured that all academic records were accessible and query-ready in the cloud environment.

## üìä Descriptive Analysis  

Descriptive analysis played a key role in this project. Using Amazon Athena, I wrote and executed SQL queries to summarize key student performance metrics. One of the initial queries calculated the overall average CGPA across all students, which resulted in approximately 2.703. This provided a baseline understanding of academic performance. To explore how performance varied across different student cohorts, I grouped the average CGPA by enrollment year. The results showed that academic outcomes fluctuated across years, offering useful insights for faculty or administration. Another important query identified the minimum CGPA in the dataset ‚Äî 1.53 ‚Äî highlighting the academic risk zone for some students. These statistics helped frame how academic standing correlates with real student data, making the policy more transparent and actionable. While the core focus was descriptive, some queries also filtered students based on academic flags, such as ‚Äúprobation‚Äù or ‚Äúsuspension,‚Äù bringing in slight elements of diagnostic analysis to make the results more useful for decision-making.

## üß™ Data Wrangling (ETL) 

To support clean and accurate descriptive analysis, I used AWS Glue DataBrew to perform data wrangling. Through recipe jobs, I removed null values, standardized data formats, transformed column names, and joined student-related datasets. This preprocessing ensured the data fed into Athena was reliable and free of inconsistencies. Additionally, I implemented a Glue Visual ETL job that included a quality check condition. Records were routed based on validation outcomes ‚Äî clean data was stored in a "Passed" folder, while incorrect or incomplete data was logged in a "Failed" folder. This modular quality control mechanism added reliability and made the data analysis process more robust and trustworthy.

## üîê Monitoring and Security  

Ensuring data security and system monitoring was a key part of this project. To secure student academic data, I enabled server-side encryption using AWS KMS with a custom key named `reg-ac-std-key-nav`. Each S3 bucket was encrypted, and versioning was turned on to protect against accidental deletions or overwrites. I also implemented cross-bucket replication rules to ensure backup and redundancy. Lifecycle policies were configured to manage storage efficiently by transitioning older files or automatically deleting temporary objects.  

To monitor the data pipeline and user activity, I used Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail. CloudWatch dashboards provided real-time visibility into resource usage and data movement, while CloudTrail tracked API calls and user actions across AWS services. This helped establish a clear audit trail and supported compliance with institutional data governance policies. The logs were stored in a centralized `awslogs` bucket for review and retention.
